Bar Breaker hides fixed headers and footers on pages you visit. It's useful for users who don't have a large screen.

To show/hide broken bars for the current page click on the extension's icon (top right corner).

To disable the extension for a particular site go to the extension's options page and add the site to exceptions.
For example to disable Bar Breaker for all pages on example.com add 'https://example.com/*' line (without quotes) to the text field with exceptions.

WARNING: The extension may not work properly on some sites.
